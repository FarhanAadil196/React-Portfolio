# My Portfolio

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules for a more robust development experience.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for enhanced React functionality:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, providing seamless updates during development.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Employs [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, offering a faster alternative to Babel.

## Project Overview

This project is created for practicing and mastering React, with a focus on building a robust portfolio.
